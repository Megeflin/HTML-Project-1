<h1>Who are we?</h1>


<p>In 1990 Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow limited-stakes gaming in Black Hawk, Central City, and Cripple Creek with the condition that a portion of gaming tax revenue be redistributed through a grants program to preserve Colorado’s historic sites. This grant program is called the State Historical Fund (SHF).</p>

<p> Our mission is to foster heritage preservation through tangible and highly visible projects for direct and demonstrable public benefit.</p>

<h2>Did you know?:</h2>


<ul>
  <li>SHF has awarded more than $290,000,000 dollars in grant funding.</li>
  <li>We have completed over 4,400 successful preservation and archaeological projects.</li>
  <li>We have awarded grants in all 64 counties in Colorado.</li>
