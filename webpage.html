        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>In 1990 Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow limited-stakes gaming in Black Hawk, Central City, and Cripple Creek with the condition that a portion of gaming tax revenue be redistributed through a grants program to preserve Coloradoâ€™s historic sites. This grant program is called the State Historical Fund (SHF).</p>
        <p> Our mission is to foster heritage preservation through tangible and highly visible projects for direct and demonstrable public benefit.</p>
